# Movie Recommender System

## Overview
This project implements a hybrid movie recommendation system using Django. It provides personalized movie recommendations for users based on a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

## Features
- Generates movie recommendations for randomly selected user IDs
- Uses a hybrid recommendation algorithm for improved accuracy
- Provides a simple API endpoint for retrieving recommendations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Lucasdeekay/movie_recommender.git
   cd movie_recommender
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
